Resources for the blueprint-studio-theme

This folder contains all kinds of static web-resources like images, fonts, CSS and JavaScript.

In order to actually include CSS and JavaScript files into the application you need to add them to the "additionalCssNonBundle" and "additionalJsNonBundle" configuration of the jangaroo-maven-plugin in the module's POM.
