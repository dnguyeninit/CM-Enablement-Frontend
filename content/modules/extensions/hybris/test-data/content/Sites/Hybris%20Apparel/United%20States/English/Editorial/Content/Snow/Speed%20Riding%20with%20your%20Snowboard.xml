The beauty of it is that you can combine skiing with flying sharpens the feeling of freedom even more.</p><p><a xlink:show="embed" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="coremedia:///cap/resources/../../Products/Freestyle%20Snowboard%20108295.xml" cmexport:path="/Sites/Hybris%20Apparel/United%20States/English/Editorial/Products/Freestyle%20Snowboard%20108295">Freestyle Snowboard 108295</a></p><p>Imagine yourself skiing on a slope, increasing your speed until at some point you are lifting up from the snow.

You can pull pretty decent G’s with it. One of the biggest adrenaline rush is when you succeeding to perfectly control with aggression yourself in a demanding surroundings with a perfect balance… this is the purest form of adrenaline, this is why we do all these sorts of extreme sports… To be in a place or a situation that normal people can’t, challenge the lows of physics. This is the secret that they will never understand and Speed riding opens you to it all and more…</p></div></detailText>
