<detailText grammarName="coremedia-richtext-1.0"><div xmlns="http://www.coremedia.com/2003/richtext-1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><p>The consumer market is currently under siege by an arsenal of fitness trackers, smart accessories, and wearable computers intent on helping you whip your body into peak physical condition.</p><p>Truth is, you’re every bit as capable at shedding pounds armed with a veggie-stocked fridge, a pair of trainers, and a jump rope as you are with a fancy heart-rate-tracking smartwatch and a pair of $300 shoes packed with sensors. But even if you keep it mostly old-school, adding a couple of digital investments to your regimen can help. They’ll show you where you’re making gains even when it doesn’t feel like you are, and they’ll help you stay motivated enough to resist the constant gravitational pull of pizza and Netflix. </p><p>Last week at CES in Las Vegas, I saw a lot of new health-tracking wearables and fitness-minded products. These are some new tools for 2015 that will help ensure your health and fitness success in the coming year.</p><p class="p--heading-3">A Smart Scale</p><p>If you have $150 to buy only one thing, get a connected scale. <a xlink:href="http://foodpsychology.cornell.edu/OP/Weigh-In" xlink:type="simple">Recent research has found</a> that weighing in at least once a week is key to keeping hard-earned pounds from creeping back. If you spend a little more to invest in a scale that wirelessly transmits your weigh-ins to your smartphone, that’s one less niggling task you’ve got to do each day. Even better is a scale that also measures your body composition. Why? At some point you’ll hit a plateau in your weight loss, and that can be disheartening. What you can’t see is that while your weight isn’t dropping, your body is still changing: Your fat percentage may be shrinking while your muscle mass is rising. Which is great! Or maybe you weigh half a pound more because you’re super hydrated. Also great! A wireless scale like <a xlink:href="http://www.withings.com/us/smart-body-analyzer.html" xlink:type="simple">Withings’ Smart Body Analyzer</a> ($150) or the <a xlink:href="http://www.getqardio.com/qardiobase-smart-scale-iphone-android/" xlink:type="simple">Qardio Base</a> (available this spring, $150) are great options for making this distinction.</p><p class="p--heading-3">MyFitnessPal</p><p>Tracking your daily food intake is also a must, and <a xlink:href="http://www.myfitnesspal.com/" xlink:type="simple">MyFitnessPal</a> makes it a snap. The free app runs on multiple mobile platforms and has several features that make it a powerful tool. First, MyFitnessPal can share its data with (and collect data from) apps like FitBit, Strava, and Apple Health. So no matter which app is your main vessel for tracking calorie count, it’s armed with the most complete and accurate information possible. Which brings us to MyFitnessPal’s incredibly vast selection of foods you can log into your daily food diary. You can choose the exact brand and amount of bread, peanut butter, and jelly for the sandwich you just made, or the precise configuration for that Chipotle burrito bowl you inhaled (no judging).</p></div></detailText>
