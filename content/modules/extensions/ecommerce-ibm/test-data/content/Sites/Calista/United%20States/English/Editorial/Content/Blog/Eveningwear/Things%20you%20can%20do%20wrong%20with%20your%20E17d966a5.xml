I design from instinct. It's the only way I know how to live. What feels good. What feels right. What is needed. Give me a problem and I will approach it creatively, from my gut. Being one step ahead of a fashion trend is not so important to me. What matters is to always forge ahead. I can't get sucked into that celebrity thing, because I think it's just crass. I am no longer concerned with sensation and innovation, but with the perfection of my style.</p><p>Fashion to me has become very disposable; I wanted to get back to craft, to clothes that could last. My job is to bring out in people what they wouldn't dare do themselves. That is the key of this collection, being yourself. Don't be into trends. Don't make fashion own you, but you decide what you are, what you want to express by the way you dress and the way to live. Luxury must be comfortable, otherwise it is not luxury. I'm an accomplice to helping women get what they want.</p><p><a xlink:show="embed" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="coremedia:///cap/resources/../../../Products/Aurora/Hermitage%20Knit%20Cocktail%20Dress%20Product%20Teaser.xml" cmexport:path="/Sites/Calista/United%20States/English/Editorial/Products/Aurora/Hermitage%20Knit%20Cocktail%20Dress%20Product%20Teaser">Evening Gown Red Product Teaser</a></p><p>Age is something only in your head or a stereotype. Age means nothing when you are passionate about something. You can't just buy things for the label - it's ridiculous. My dresses are very reasonably priced, for dresses that are cut on the body. I never look at other people's work. My mind has to be completely focused on my own illusions. My customers are successful workingwomen.</p><p>Luxury will be always around, no matter what happens in the world. I don't really know how to do casual clothes. Fashion fades, only style remains the same. Even Michelangelo got paid for doing the Sistine Chapel. To those artists who say they're doing it for the love of art, I say: Get real. Fashion can be this mysterious thing that you can't explain.</p></div></detailText>
