<detailText grammarName="coremedia-richtext-1.0"><div xmlns="http://www.coremedia.com/2003/richtext-1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><p>Chef Corp. has delivered over 6000 kitchens in the last 5 years. Our 6000th kitchen was installed for the <em>Colchique</em>, a high-class restaurant in the heart of Marseille. "We were very happy with our previous Chef Corp. kitchen, but when we decided to do a major renovation of our restaurant, the time was right for a new one," says Pierre Gardiner, head chef of the Colchique. "I am more than satisfied, in fact, the quality of service has astounded me and my manager. We were prepared for a headache, but the experience was quite smooth." Surely, the experience of our delivery manager Jaques Dumont and his team has played a role in that.</p><p/><p>The kitchen utilizes the available 40 m² to an unprecedented degree – no surface is left unused yet the kitchen does not appear crammed. The partitioning and organization was based on Pierre's wishes. "We are very happy with the design. Jaques helped is make the most of the space, and his insights were very valuable."</p><p/><p>Pierre and his manager have opted for our no-hassle lifetime service plan. This choice ensures a high maintenance standard for the Colchique's kitchen for the remainder of its service life – hopefully years of great cooking and happy guests. Visit the Colchique in Marseille for a taste of great food, provided by outstanding chefs and a state-of-the-art Chef Corp. kitchen.</p></div></detailText>
