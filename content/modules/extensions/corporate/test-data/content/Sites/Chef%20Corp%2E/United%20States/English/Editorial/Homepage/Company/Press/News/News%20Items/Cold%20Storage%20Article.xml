  <div xmlns="http://www.coremedia.com/2003/richtext-1.0"><p>Poorly insulated cold storages are responsible for over 5,000,000 tons of unnecessary carbon dioxide emissions per year in the US, according to a recent study by the Fountainhead College of Tech. (TN). The lackluster insulation incurs costs in the millions and is a sign of saving on the wrong thing. In the long run, "poorly conceived or damaged insulation can easily outweigh savings" on design and maintenance, the scientists reveal.</p><p>Most of the offending cold storages come from a period of time where energy costs were as low as the average appreciation for our environment. Nowadays, both have risen but our cold storages have yet to follow.</p><p>Is your cold storage energy efficient? Here are three signs that it is not:</p><ol><li><strong>Your staff loiters in the cold storage.</strong><br/>It is obviously not cold enough or most of the cold leaks out through cracks or the door.</li><li><strong>Meat does not keep fresh for as long as you'd like.</strong><br/>We all know that the shelf-life of meat is much longer than the package says as long as the temperature is kept low enough. If it spoils after a few weeks, your cold storage is not only ineffective, it is a liability and you are at a disadvantage to your competitors.</li><li><strong>Vermin.</strong><br/>There is no excuse for bad hygiene, but even the most careful restaurants are sometimes affected. A bad dumpster in the neighborhood is all that is needed. However, if you have vermin in your cold storage, it <em>is</em> the bad dumpster in your neighborhood, and you need to clear it out.</li></ol><p>Chef Corp. offers installation and maintenance service for your cold storage at a fair price. We use only the latest technology in insulation, based on natural coconut fibers and a special insulating polyester resin. With our Maintenance and Modernization Plan, Chef Corp. guarantees energy savings. How high they are depends on the quality of your current configuration. We are confident, though, that we can make you an offer that not only lowers your energy cost but also keeps the initial investment at a manageable level. Have a chat with one of our sales representatives for detailed information.</p><p>Be advised that our cold storage units come with an extended and flexible Service and Maintenance Plan that is tailored to your needs and financial abilities.</p><p>And remember: <strong>Energy savings are guaranteed with Chef Corp. cold storages</strong>.</p></div></detailText>
