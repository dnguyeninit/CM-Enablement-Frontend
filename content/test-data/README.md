# CoreMedia Blueprint

## Example Content and Users

This folder is the place where you can put content that should be imported automatically, when using the content import of the docker-compose development setup.
Place content below the `content` folder and a `users.xml` below the `users` folder to import predefined users.

When you build this module the content will be packaged into a content-users.zip for automatic
provisioning.
