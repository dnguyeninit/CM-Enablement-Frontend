License Management
==================

place your licenses in this directory using the names:

* cms-license.zip
* mls-license.zip
* rls-license.zip

or set the following environment variables prior to executing the
`compose.sh` script, to retrieve the licenses during server startup:

* `CMS_LICENSE_URL`
* `MLS_LICENSE_URL`
* `RLS_LICENSE_URL`
